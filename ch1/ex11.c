 * Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input
 * are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?
 *
 * I would suggest testing the program with multiple blank/tab/newline
 * characters in a row, as well as with leading/ending blank/tab/newline
 * characters and one-character words.
